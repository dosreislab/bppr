# bppr: a helper R package for BPP

Currently the package is useful to calibrate phylogenies from a BPP A00 analysis to absolute divergence times by using either a fossil calibration on a node age, or a prior on the per-generation rate and generation time. In the latter case a posterior sample of the effective population sizes is obtained.
